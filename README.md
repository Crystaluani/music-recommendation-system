## Project Title
Music Recommendation System Using Python and Streamlit

## Project Description
A system that recommends songs to users based on their preferences or listening history.
 Helps users discover new music tailored to their tastes, enhancing user engagement for music platforms.

This project is a music recommendation system designed to suggest songs based on user preferences, genres, or listening history. The goal is to create a seamless user experience by providing personalized recommendations in real-time.


The dataset includes 50,000 songs with attributes such as song_name, artist, genre, tempo, energy, and user ratings. It was sourced from the Spotify API.


User Input: Accepts input for favorite songs or genres.
Recommendation Method: Generates recommendations using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or a hybrid approach.
Interactivity: Provides an intuitive interface built with Streamlit.


Users can search for a favorite song or genre, and the system recommends similar tracks.
Recommendations are based on song attributes and user similarity.
The interface is built using Streamlit for a simple and interactive user experience.


Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Handling: pandas, NumPy
Machine Learning: scikit-learn, Surprise
Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn
Web App: Streamlit
APIs: Spotify API for additional song data

## Architecture
Include a workflow or step-by-step outline:

Data preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized song attributes.
Feature extraction: Calculated similarity scores using cosine similarity or matrix factorization.
Model training: Built models for collaborative filtering using user-item matrices.
Streamlit interface: Developed an interactive app for user input and displaying recommendations.

## Results
Highlight outcomes and performance:

Evaluation Metrics: RMSE.

9. Streamlit App
Describe the app functionality:

User Interface: Dropdown menus to select favorite songs or genres.
Real-Time Results: Recommendations displayed instantly with song details.
Features: Interactive filters for genres or moods.
Example:

The app allows users to input a favorite song, artist, or genre. Recommendations are displayed with details like song name, artist, and genre. Users can refine results using filters for energy, tempo, or mood.
